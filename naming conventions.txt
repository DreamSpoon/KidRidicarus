Work in progress, general notes collected so far:

Choose one of these:
	prevParentMoveState
	parentPrevMoveState

While refactoring MarioSprite class at about commit SHA1 ID: 0c8a2d78231c81b6565e168bf23a0090669526f8
Re: To name a varaible for the previous move state of the parent (class Mario)
Result: parentPrevMoveState
Because:
	If the class has a variable named "parent", then
	To group things together it would make sense to
	Name variables as such:
		Object parent;
		MoveState parentPrevMoveState;
		MoveState parentMoveState;
		Object child;
		MoveState childPrevMoveState;
		MoveState childMoveState;
