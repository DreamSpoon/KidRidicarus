# Kid Ridicarus

## Mashup of Super Mario Bros. 1, Metroid, and Kid Icarus.

### Intent:

Mashup the first levels of 3 of my favorite games of the 80s.

Mario will be able to play in his world, in Metroid world and Kid Icarus world. Likewise with Samus and the Kid.

### Process:

Using [Brent Aureli's SMB code](https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario) (retrieved about Oct 17, 2018) as a starting point, modify as needed.

### Coding Sources:

Brent Aureli's YouTube series [Creating Super Mario Bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8MPxzkwBwo&list=PLZm85UZQLd2SXQzsF-a0-pPF6IWDDdrXt)

### Tools:

[TilEd](www.mapeditor.org)

[TexturePacker](www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)

### Sprite / Tile / Map Resources:

[NESMAPS.COM](www.nesmaps.com)

[The Spriters Resource](www.spriters-resource.com)

[GIMP Addon - Sprite Gutter Add/Remove tool](https://gimper.net/threads/add-remove-sprite-sheet-gutter-padding-and-spacing.14189/)

* Great for preparing tilesets for use (read up on TilED and libGDX tile maps to know why).

### Other:

[SMB Physics Doc](http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk21/jdaster64/smb_playerphysics.png.html)

### Current State of Affairs:

* Mario can do all the regular stuff, even ducking, but ducking under things and then squeezing by is not implemented.

* Next stuff to add is the end flag, dying when falling out of level, squeezing out of tight spaces when unducking.
