# Kid Ridicarus

## Mashup of Super Mario Bros., Metroid, and Kid Icarus

### Intent:

Mashup the first levels of 3 of my favorite games of the 80s.

Mario will be able to play in his world, in Metroid world and Kid Icarus world. Likewise with Samus and the Kid.

### Current State of Affairs:

* Super Mario Bros. 1 almost done, still needs:

  * Squeezing out of tight spaces when unducking

  * End of level part of game needs time to points conversion countdown

  * Some minor fixes (e.g. sometimes mario stops using jump force too early, enemies tend to "stick" together when there are many close together)

* Metroid is on the horizon

### Process:

* Coding

  * Write code in Eclipse IDE

  * libGDX for graphics, sound, input

  * Using [Brent Aureli's SMB code](https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario) (retrieved about Oct 17, 2018) as a starting point, modify as needed

  * When stumped, Google stuff and usually find things on [Stack Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com) or [BadLogicGames](www.badlogicgames.com).

* Graphics

  * Use sprites from Spriters Resource, NESMAPS.COM

  * Process sprite images with GIMP (and Sprite Gutter Add/Remove tool)

  * Pack sprite images with TexturePacker

* Audio

  * Use sounds from The Sounds Resource, and music from the Video Game Music Preservation Foundation

  * Use Audacity for modifying/converting audio

* Game

  * FCEUX with the emulation speed turned down to 50%
  
  * Save AVI videos from FCEUX, watch videos with ShotCut to see the action frame by frame

  * TilEd for creating maps
