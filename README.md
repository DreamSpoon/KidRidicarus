# Kid Ridicarus

Mashup the first levels of of Super Mario Bros., Metroid, and Kid Icarus.

Mario will be able to play in his world, in Metroid world and Kid Icarus world. Likewise with Samus and the Kid.

### Current State of Affairs:

* Super Mario Bros. 1 - Level 1-1
  * All characters - Mario, Goomba, Turtle
  * All powerups - Coin, Magic Mushroom, Fire Flower, Power Star
  * All scripts - Pipe Warp, Level End Flag
  * Needs polish - e.g. head bump tile sometimes doesn't work at moderate to high X velocity

* Metroid - Level 1 (?)
  * All characters - Samus, Zoomer, Skree, Rio
  * All powerups - Energy, Maru Mari
  * All scripts - Metroid Door
  * Needs polish - e.g. Rio should swoop up when player is above Rio, and Metroid Door transition needs a better visual

* Kid Icarus - Level 1-1
  * Some characters - Pit, Shemum, Monoeye (with QQ)
  * Some powerups - Small Heart, Half Heart
  * No scripts - e.g. end-of-level walk and points countdown
  * Needs polish - e.g. Monoeye QQ movements

### To Build (or not to build?):

* This is a Gradle project, so import it (I use Eclipse IDE)

* libGDX library is used (with Box2D enabled)

### Game Category Name (working idea)

Multiple Platform Game Emulator (MPGE)

* Kid Ridicarus emulates multiple games in the platform game genre
