# Kid Ridicarus

## Mashup of Super Mario Bros., Metroid, and Kid Icarus

### Intent:

Mashup the first levels of 3 of my favorite games of the 80s.

Mario will be able to play in his world, in Metroid world and Kid Icarus world. Likewise with Samus and the Kid.

### Current State of Affairs:

* Mario can do all the regular stuff, even ducking, but ducking under things and then squeezing by is not implemented.

* Flagpole implemented. Warp pipes implemented recently.

* Next stuff to add is dying when falling out of level, squeezing out of tight spaces when unducking, coins, better HUD.

### Process:

Using [Brent Aureli's SMB code](https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario) (retrieved about Oct 17, 2018) as a starting point, modify as needed.
