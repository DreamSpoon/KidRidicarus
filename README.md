# Kid Ridicarus

##Mashup of Super Mario Bros. 1, Metroid, and Kid Icarus.

###Intent:

Mashup the first levels of 3 of my favorite games of the 80s.

Mario will be able to play in his world, in Metroid world and Kid Icarus world. Likewise with Samus and the Kid.

###Process:

Using [Brent Aureli's SMB code](https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario) (retrieved about Oct 17, 2018) as a starting point, modify as needed.

###Coding Sources:

Brent Aureli's YouTube series: [Creating Super Mario Bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8MPxzkwBwo&list=PLZm85UZQLd2SXQzsF-a0-pPF6IWDDdrXt)

###Current State of Affairs:

* Fire Mario. Most mario characteristics are done, e.g. jumping, braking, falling, but Mario ducking is missing.

* Next stuff to add is probably 10-Coin and Star blocks, then Mario duck, then the end flag.
