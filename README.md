# Kid Ridicarus
Mashup of Super Mario Bros. 1, Metroid, and Kid Icarus.

Intent:
  Mashup the first levels of 3 of my favorite games of the 80s.
  Mario will be able to play in his world, in Metroid world and Kid Icarus world. Likewise with Samus and the Kid.

Process:
  Using Brent Aureli's code (https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario, retrieved about Oct 17, 2018) as a starting point, modify as needed.
